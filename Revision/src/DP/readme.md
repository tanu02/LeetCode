if permutation considered ab ba diff then dp with simple loop forward
    climb stair, comb4,  decode ways (111 -> (1, 1, 1 ) (1,11) (11, 1) 
if ab  ba are  diff then loop will be moving  forward without considering  prev entries  
    coin change 2  
    
1) initialize  dp with n+1 target/weight/sum
2) word break/decode ways dp n size  
3) lcs n+1 

Decode ways == word break 
have state as a starting index  and all the substrings corresponding to that index
